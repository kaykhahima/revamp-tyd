                                    <p class="body-text  mb-2">As a matter of keeping its promises, TYD has received many application that have been examined to get practicable innovations that can be taken care of. After a careful scrutiny, TYD managed to get a good number of ideas that are really innovative from at least 20 first applicants.</p>

                                    <p class="body-text  mb-2">Innovators were invited for the first round presentation. On 13th July, 2018 first round presentations begun and the ideas were made clearer and a call for strategic action were drawn.</p>

                                    <p class="body-text  mb-2">After a preparation of a blueprint of such ideas, the ideas are going to be registered by the government regulatory authorities for ownership in partnership between TYD and the originators of those ideas, before kicking-off projects on implementing those ideas.</p>

                                    <p class="body-text  mb-2">Mr. Geofrey Chami, the Managing Director of TYD Innovation Incubator while leading other innovator to present and improve their ideas, insisted that: “Having presented your innovative ideas to us, you are automatically contributing to the socio-economic development of our country, and that is a generosity of very high level”.</p>

                                    <p class="body-text  mb-2">While the incubator will still be inviting more ideas and conducting presentations for the current round, it is still encouraging more individuals and organisation to collaborate with it to make sure that the impact of what is carried on is massive.</p>
